# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) UI

## Overview

This project implements a **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** system for managing users, roles, and permissions through a clean, user-friendly admin dashboard. It allows administrators to manage users, define roles, assign permissions, and ensure secure and efficient access control across the application.

The system has three main components:
- **User Management**: Add, edit, delete, and manage users with roles and statuses.
- **Role Management**: Define and edit roles with associated permissions (e.g., Read, Write, Delete).
- **Dynamic Permissions**: Assign and modify permissions for each role dynamically.

## Key Features

- **User Management**:
  - Add new users.
  - Edit and update user details.
  - Delete users.
  - Assign and manage user roles (Active/Inactive status).

- **Role Management**:
  - Create new roles.
  - Edit and delete existing roles.
  - Assign specific permissions (Read, Write, Delete, etc.) to roles.

- **Dynamic Permissions**:
  - Display permissions in a user-friendly way for easy assignment.
  - Modify permissions per role.

- **Responsive Design**:
  - The dashboard is fully responsive, ensuring a smooth user experience on various screen sizes.

- **Mock API Simulation** (Optional):
  - Simulates API calls to interact with user and role data, providing realistic CRUD operations and server responses.
